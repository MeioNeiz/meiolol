# Draft model: how good is it?

Measured with `meiolol eval` (src/eval.zig) on a read-only copy of the box DB. Rerun as
data grows; add a dated section, keep the old ones (the curve over training size is
evidence for the production key).

```
meiolol eval --data DIR [--patch P] [--platform P] [--test-share 0.2] [--folds 5]
```

## Method

- Time split: newest 20% of games held out (test), models built only from older games
  (train). Never random: same-day games share meta and flatter every model
- Tuning (prior strengths, term weights) by 5-fold inside train only; test touched once
- Full draft: blue side's win chance. Log loss (lower is better, coin flip 0.6931),
  Brier, AUC, accuracy, calibration by decile. "± x" is the 95% interval of the paired
  per-game log loss difference to the current model: an improvement only counts when
  its interval excludes 0
- Pick metric: each test pick hidden in turn, the other nine known with roles;
  percentile of the champion actually picked among all candidates (champions with 10+
  train games in the role). If the model knows good picks, winners' picks rank higher
  than losers' (AUC above 0.5), and picks in its top 10% win more than 50%
- Role inference: all five roles of a test team hidden, share placed right
- Learning curve: same test games, models from the newest N train games
- Ceiling: published draft-only models reach ~55-57% accuracy on millions of games
  (research: loldraftai#^f6, #^f7, loldraftai-site#^f4); log loss ~0.68 at best.
  Small gains matter; honest intervals matter more

## Baselines, 2026-10-11 (6669 EUW games, patches 16.19-16.20)

Train 5335 games (27 Sep to 8 Oct), test 1334 (8 to 11 Oct, all 16.20).

| model | log loss | Brier | AUC | accuracy | log loss vs current |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| coin flip (50%) | 0.6931 | 0.2500 | 0.500 | 50.0% | +0.0002 ± 0.0032 |
| blue side rate (51.0%) | 0.6930 | 0.2499 | 0.500 | 51.0% | -0.0000 ± 0.0034 |
| champion base only | 0.6921 | 0.2495 | 0.527 | 51.6% | -0.0009 ± 0.0012 |
| current model (priors 1000/1000) | 0.6930 | 0.2499 | 0.520 | 50.5% | - |
| tuned priors (3200/800) | 0.6933 | 0.2501 | 0.512 | 50.9% | +0.0004 ± 0.0012 |
| tuned + term weights | 0.6930 | 0.2499 | 0.510 | 50.7% | +0.0001 ± 0.0020 |

- Nothing beats a coin flip measurably. Predictions span only 48-54% and calibration
  deciles are noise. Champion base rates alone are as good as anything (pair terms add
  noise at this size, not signal)
- Tuning (out-of-fold): wants heavy shrinkage, base prior 1600+ and pair prior 800+;
  pairs "off" is within 0.0001 of the best. Term weights 0.6-0.8 (shrink further),
  intercept 0.04 (blue side ~51%). None of it carried over to test measurably
- Newest patch only (481 train games, what `meiolol stats` builds by default) vs every
  patch: same test loss within noise (0.6925 vs 0.6930, ±0.0012)
- Pick metric (current model): winners' picks at the 53.3rd percentile, losers' at
  52.6th, AUC 0.506; picks in the model's top 10% won 50.6% (2771 picks). No signal
- Role inference: 91.6% of champions placed right, 81.5% of teams fully right; worst
  top (87.6%) and mid (88.2%), best bot (95.0%)
- Learning curve, 250 to 5335 train games: flat at 0.692-0.693 for every model

Why: a champion-role has ~60 games here, so its winrate is known to about ±6 pp, while
real differences between champions are 1-3 pp. Pair cells have a handful of games.
The data is the bottleneck, not the model form; the all-regions crawl (~135k games/day)
is what can move these numbers. Detectable now: the paired interval is ±0.0012 on 1334
test games, so a model at the published ~55% (log loss ~0.687) would show clearly.

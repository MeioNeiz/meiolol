# Draft model: how good is it?

Measured with `meiolol eval` (src/eval.zig) on a read-only copy of the box DB. Rerun as
data grows; add a dated section, keep the old ones (the curve over training size is
evidence for the production key).

```
meiolol eval --data DIR [--patch P] [--platform P] [--test-platform P]
             [--test-share 0.2] [--folds 5]
```

Copy of the box DB without touching the live one (python3 on the box, read-only source):
`sqlite3.connect("file:.../meiolol.db?mode=ro", uri=True).backup(sqlite3.connect(dst))`.

The box runs it daily (deploy/web-loop.sh, ~9 min) into data/eval-history.tsv. Watch it
from here: `deploy/box.sh model [ROWS] [-f]` (run state, AUC sparklines per model, last
runs with the best log loss vs coin flip; -f redraws every minute). Charts and the latest
report: the admin page's Model tab.

Training runs on the Mac (deploy/lab-run.sh start mac ...) show live in the admin page's
Training tab (https://meiolol.jomify.lol/admin/#training; deploy/lab-push.sh,
docs/hosting.md). A run reports progress by appending to metrics.tsv in its run directory
(the working directory): a header, then a row per evaluation, first column the x axis
(step, epoch, games), the rest numbers.
Columns sharing the part after the last `_` share a chart (`train_loss`, `test_loss`),
and each prefix keeps its colour across charts. Flush each row as it is written.

## Method

- Time split: newest 20% of games held out (test), models built only from older games
  (train). Never random: same-day games share meta and flatter every model
- Tuning (prior strengths, term weights) by 5-fold inside train only; test touched once
- Full draft: blue side's win chance. Log loss (lower is better, coin flip 0.6931),
  Brier, AUC, accuracy, calibration by decile. "± x" is the 95% interval of the paired
  per-game log loss difference to the current model: an improvement only counts when
  its interval excludes 0
- Pick metric: each test pick hidden in turn, the other nine known with roles;
  percentile of the champion actually picked among all candidates (champions with 10+
  train games in the role). If the model knows good picks, winners' picks rank higher
  than losers' (AUC above 0.5), and picks in its top 10% win more than 50%
- Role inference: all five roles of a test team hidden, share placed right
- Learning curve: same test games, models from the newest N train games
- Ceiling: published draft-only models reach ~55-57% accuracy on millions of games
  (research: loldraftai#^f6, #^f7, loldraftai-site#^f4); log loss ~0.68 at best.
  Small gains matter; honest intervals matter more

## Baselines, 2026-10-11 (6669 EUW games, patches 16.19-16.20)

Train 5335 games (27 Sep to 8 Oct), test 1334 (8 to 11 Oct, all 16.20).

| model | log loss | Brier | AUC | accuracy | log loss vs current |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| coin flip (50%) | 0.6931 | 0.2500 | 0.500 | 50.0% | +0.0002 ± 0.0032 |
| blue side rate (51.0%) | 0.6930 | 0.2499 | 0.500 | 51.0% | -0.0000 ± 0.0034 |
| champion base only | 0.6921 | 0.2495 | 0.527 | 51.6% | -0.0009 ± 0.0012 |
| current model (priors 1000/1000) | 0.6930 | 0.2499 | 0.520 | 50.5% | - |
| tuned priors (3200/800) | 0.6933 | 0.2501 | 0.512 | 50.9% | +0.0004 ± 0.0012 |
| tuned + term weights | 0.6930 | 0.2499 | 0.510 | 50.7% | +0.0001 ± 0.0020 |

- Nothing beats a coin flip measurably. Predictions span only 48-54% and calibration
  deciles are noise. Champion base rates alone are as good as anything (pair terms add
  noise at this size, not signal)
- Tuning (out-of-fold): wants heavy shrinkage, base prior 1600+ and pair prior 800+;
  pairs "off" is within 0.0001 of the best. Term weights 0.6-0.8 (shrink further),
  intercept 0.04 (blue side ~51%). None of it carried over to test measurably
- Newest patch only (481 train games, what `meiolol stats` builds by default) vs every
  patch: same test loss within noise (0.6925 vs 0.6930, ±0.0012)
- Pick metric (current model): winners' picks at the 53.3rd percentile, losers' at
  52.6th, AUC 0.506; picks in the model's top 10% won 50.6% (2771 picks). No signal
- Role inference: 91.6% of champions placed right, 81.5% of teams fully right; worst
  top (87.6%) and mid (88.2%), best bot (95.0%)
- Learning curve, 250 to 5335 train games: flat at 0.692-0.693 for every model

### Changes measured the same day (same split)

| model | log loss | AUC | log loss vs current | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| empirical-Bayes priors (score.empiricalPriors) | 0.6922 | 0.527 | -0.0008 ± 0.0014 | opt-in, not default |
| joint ratings, L2 logistic (logreg.zig, l2 300) | 0.6920 | 0.527 | -0.0010 ± 0.0018 | eval only |

- Empirical Bayes (method of moments, unweighted over cells with 30+ games, needs 100+
  cells; meiolol-bb's research/questions/curve-statistics-method.md, Brown 2008):
  base prior 1226 games, every pair kind (duo, lane, other matchups) "off" (spread not
  measurable). It adapts as data grows and needs no grid. A 95%-lower-bound variant
  switched everything off (coin flip); with fewer than 100 cells the point estimate
  overfit (0.7235 at 250 train games), hence the cell floor
- Joint ratings: champion-role ratings fitted together (adjusts for teammates and
  opponents), the same form as a trained model will take. Out-of-fold L2 300 matches a
  ~1000-game prior. Level with marginal base rates here
- Neither beats the current model beyond noise, so app, site and Daily Draft keep
  `.{}` defaults. Switch to `empiricalPriors(...).apply(.{})` once eval shows a gain at
  volume
- `--test-platform EUW1`: test on one region, compare training on it alone with every
  scanned platform pooled (all-regions data from 2026-10-11)

- Role inference with pair evidence (log lift of two teammates' co-occurrence in those
  roles over play-rate independence, added to the brute-force score): 88.8% of
  champions right vs 91.6%, 75.8% of teams vs 81.5%. Sparse pairs add noise; reverted.
  Retry with pair shrinkage at volume
- All platforms (15, 7.9k games after the all-regions deploy), test EUW1: base-only and
  EB ~0.692, current 0.6936; training on EUW only vs pooled within noise. Lane gold
  section (lanegold.zig) waits for 500 train and 100 test games with timelines
- From 2026-10-11 the box appends a line a day to data/eval-history.tsv
  (deploy/web-loop.sh): the accuracy-vs-data curve

- Player experience (experience.zig, eval "Player experience"): a term per bin on top of
  the out-of-fold draft terms, every known player (upper bound) vs one player per game
  (the user, what the app can know), from crawled history game numbers (learning.zig
  bins) and mastery points (snapshot after the match: flattering). First run 2026-10-11
  after the rekey: 585 train / 0 test games with a crawled history, 0 with mastery;
  skipped (needs 300 / 100)

## Shared protocol, 2026-10-12 (meiolol-3c and meiolol-2a)

Both model agents score on the same rows so their numbers compare. Agreed between them;
outcomes and readings decided by Jacob the same day.

- Data: one snapshot of the three box DBs (VACUUM INTO), PUUIDs replaced by salted
  hashes, forgotten players dropped, deleted when a newer snapshot replaces it.
  Snapshot snap-20261012T2055Z (hashed; data/snap-20261012T2055Z on the Mac,
  ~/ml/snaps/ on the gpu-box): 224,910 games scanned, patches 16.19-16.20, 15
  platforms. Test from game_start 1791709711585 (11 Oct): 10,759 EUW1 games, 10,604
  reaching 15:00 with a timeline; train 174,575 games, 117,806 reaching 15:00. Every
  test game and its frame count in split.tsv, finished items per patch in
  legendaries.tsv (both in the snapshot dir)
- Split: eval's. Test = newest 20% of EUW1 games by gameCreation; train = older games,
  every platform. Tuning by folds inside train only; test touched once per model
- Rows: ranked solo, non-remake, complete roles (stats.scan rules). Continuous outcomes
  also need a compact timeline that reached 15:00: frames[15].t_ms >= 900000 (frame 15
  exists is not enough: games ending 14:09-14:59 have it as their end frame). Platinum
  IV+ only (crawl floor)
- Outcomes:
  - win: log loss, paired interval vs champion base rates
  - gold14: total_gold at frame 14
  - lanediff14: gold14 minus the lane opponent's gold14
  - cs10: minions + jungle_minions at frame 10
  - deaths15: CHAMPION_KILL events with victim = p and t < 900000 ms
  - first_item: minutes (fractional) of p's first ITEM_PURCHASED of an item in the
    patch's finished set (ddragon.legendaries: SR, purchasable, in store, cost >= 2200,
    builds into nothing, not boots/consumable/champion-only), not cancelled by an
    ITEM_UNDO (before = item, after = 0; take the next one). Sold or destroyed later
    still counts; quest/Ornn/transform upgrades don't. Never completed = censored:
    out of the MSE, censored share reported per champion-role beside it. Finished sets
    per patch in data/snap-<stamp>/legendaries.tsv (offline)
  - continuous outcomes: held-out MSE vs champion-role mean (train), paired per-row
    intervals
- A gain counts only when its 95% interval excludes 0. Baselines to beat: champion base
  rates for everyone; 3c's additive models for 2a's interaction and embedding models
  (shared per-row prediction file, paired between any two models)
- Each model labelled with train-time features and champ-select (use-time) features.
  Use-time: champions, roles, the user's own rank and experience, aggregate facts only.
  Other players' stats and end-of-game stats: training covariates or post-game lessons,
  never champ-select inputs

### Team effects on early outcomes, 2026-10-12 (meiolol-3c)

`meiolol outcomes --data SNAP --platform all --preds DIR` (src/outcomes.zig) on
snap-20261012T2055Z. Train 117,806 games, test 10,604 EUW1 games (rows above, with the
game reaching 15:00: frames[15] at 900000 ms or later), ten rows per game.

Additive models, each group of effects fitted in turn on the others' residual
(backfitting) and shrunk toward 0 by a method-of-moments prior per group and role;
outcomes standardised per role on train. Groups: platform; champion; lane opponent
(own champion x opponent); bot lane partners (bottom and support, ally and enemy);
junglers (for laners); the rest of both teams; own class x enemy class counts (Data
Dragon first tag); own champion x enemy class counts; own champion x each non-lane
enemy champion. Train-time and use-time features: champions and roles only (all
champ-select legal). Preds: data/preds/snap-20261012T2055Z/ (base-champrole, 3c-*).

Gains are % of the champion-role-mean test MSE removed by each step over the one
before it, ± 95% interval clustered by game:

| step | gold14 | lanediff14 | cs10 | deaths15 | first_item |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| platform + champion (shrunk) | 0.13 ± 0.04 | 0.03 ± 0.02 | 2.26 ± 0.16 | 0.18 ± 0.06 | 0.27 ± 0.06 |
| + lane opponent | 1.13 ± 0.15 | 3.47 ± 0.26 | 2.94 ± 0.21 | 1.62 ± 0.16 | 0.97 ± 0.13 |
| + bot lane partners | 0.80 ± 0.11 | 0.64 ± 0.13 | 0.94 ± 0.12 | 0.70 ± 0.10 | 0.52 ± 0.10 |
| + junglers | 0.23 ± 0.06 | 0.17 ± 0.06 | 0.06 ± 0.04 | 0.32 ± 0.08 | 0.06 ± 0.03 |
| + rest of both teams | 0.32 ± 0.08 | 0.24 ± 0.09 | 0.36 ± 0.09 | 0.78 ± 0.13 | 0.09 ± 0.05 |
| total, additive (3c-team) | 2.61 ± 0.22 | 4.55 ± 0.33 | 6.55 ± 0.31 | 3.60 ± 0.27 | 1.90 ± 0.19 |
| + own class x enemy classes | 0.03 ± 0.02 | 0.06 ± 0.04 | -0.00 ± 0.03 | 0.04 ± 0.03 | 0.02 ± 0.02 |
| + own champion x enemy classes | -0.02 ± 0.02 | -0.01 ± 0.02 | -0.03 ± 0.03 | -0.03 ± 0.03 | -0.04 ± 0.03 |
| + own champion x enemy champion (on 3c-team) | 0.00 ± 0.01 | 0.00 ± 0.00 | -0.02 ± 0.04 | 0.00 ± 0.00 | 0.00 ± 0.01 |

Test RMSE, champion-role mean -> 3c-team, by role (top, jungle, mid, bot, support):
gold14 898/784/820/982/567 -> 884/779/810/965/560 gold; lanediff14
1586/1201/1359/1647/807 -> 1551/1180/1330/1612/780 gold; cs10 13.0/9.8/11.8/11.6/4.8 ->
12.4/9.4/11.4/11.3/4.7; deaths15 1.8/1.5/1.7/1.8/1.7 -> 1.8/1.5/1.7/1.7/1.7; first_item
2.4/1.7/1.9/2.0/2.5 -> 2.3/1.7/1.9/2.0/2.5 minutes. Most of the spread is the game itself, not
the draft.

Spread of true effects (sd of shrunk-model effects, gold at 14): own champion 270-360;
lane opponent 74-196 (27 jungle vs jungle); bot partners 100-180 for bottom and support;
a jungler 20-65; anyone else 15-50 per champion; own class x enemy classes 0-33; own
champion x enemy classes 0-46 (2 of 5 roles), own champion x enemy champion 0-21 (off
in 3 roles). Deaths before 15: lane 0.1-0.35, a jungler 0.1-0.17, anyone else
0.04-0.11 per champion; interactions under 0.13.

first_item censoring (no finished item by game end, games past 15:00): top 1.1%,
support 1.3%, others 0.4% or less. Supports do finish a legendary in nearly every game,
so their effects are usable.

Reading:
- Who is in the game matters beyond the lane: the bot lane partners, the junglers and
  the other three each shift gold, CS, deaths and item timing, all clear of 0. Deaths
  before 15 move most with the rest of the enemy team (0.78%, about half the lane's)
- It is additive: the same enemy shifts everyone in a role about equally. "Your
  champion against this enemy team" (by class or by champion) adds nothing detectable
  at 118k games; the shrinkage switches most of it off. So today "vs the five" can be
  shown as lane matchup plus the sum of each enemy's effect, not as a champion-specific
  team counter. 2a's embedding and interaction models must beat 3c-team to show more
- Gains are small in MSE terms (a lane matchup is ~1-3.5%) because one game's numbers
  are mostly the game. They are real: intervals are a tenth of the gains

### Champion embeddings against the enemy team, 2026-10-12 (meiolol-2a)

`meiolol-lab enemy SNAP preds` (src/lab/enemy.zig, fm.zig) on snap-20261012T2055Z, the
same rows; run 20261012T2210Z-enemy7 on the gpu-box (dcbd6f0). Nested models per
outcome, fitted by Adam with L2, grid (dim 4/8/16, L2) and epochs picked on the newest
20% of train, refit on all train, test once:

- additive: champion-role mean + platform x role + each enemy and ally champion-role's
  effect on my role
- lane: + an embedding interaction with the lane opponent only (both enemies for bot
  and support): w[my role][their role] * <u[me], v[them]>
- pairwise: the same interaction with all five enemies, each role pair weighted

Use-time features: champions, roles, platform (champ-select legal). Compared with
`meiolol-lab pairs` (src/lab/pairs.zig): gain as % of base-champrole MSE in raw outcome
units (3c's table above standardises per role first, so its % differ slightly; on raw
units 3c-team is 2.75 / 4.31 / 7.70 / 3.65 / 2.00), ± 95% clustered by game:

| comparison | gold14 | lanediff14 | cs10 | deaths15 | first_item |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lane vs additive (lane interaction) | 0.41 ± 0.11 | 0.60 ± 0.16 | 0.77 ± 0.18 | 0.04 ± 0.07 | 0.44 ± 0.10 |
| pairwise vs lane (the other four enemies) | -0.13 ± 0.09 | -0.09 ± 0.06 | 0.02 ± 0.12 | 0.03 ± 0.05 | -0.06 ± 0.09 |
| lane vs 3c-team | 0.22 ± 0.13 | 0.79 ± 0.19 | 0.23 ± 0.19 | 0.46 ± 0.12 | 0.07 ± 0.30 |
| additive vs 3c-team | -0.19 ± 0.17 | 0.19 ± 0.25 | -0.54 ± 0.22 | 0.42 ± 0.13 | -0.37 ± 0.32 |

Interaction size in the pairwise model (RMS of the term on test rows), where it is free
to weight any role pair: gold14 top vs top 97 gold, mid vs mid 32, bot vs bot 9, every
other pair under 7; lanediff14 top 216, mid 104, bot vs bot 47 and vs support 42, off
the lane 0-27; jungle vs anyone ~0.

Reading:
- The answer to "your champion against the whole enemy team" is the same as 3c's:
  champion-specific interactions live in the lane. Letting every enemy interact adds
  nothing (pairwise vs lane within noise, slightly negative); the model itself puts
  its interaction weight on the lane diagonal. Beyond the lane the enemy team acts
  additively (3c's groups), at 118k train games
- A low-rank lane interaction (embeddings) beats 3c's shrunk lane-pair cells on
  lanediff14 (+0.79) and gold14 (+0.22): pairs with few games borrow from similar
  champions. Worth carrying into the lane curves where pair cells are thin
- deaths15: additive alone beats 3c-team (+0.42), so the gain is in the additive part
  (ally/enemy terms by my role, unshrunk), not interactions; worth checking which
  group with 3c
- Compute: each fit is 1-5 s single-threaded on 1.2M rows; a whole run (5 outcomes x
  4 models x grid) is ~5 minutes on one gpu-box core. No GPU needed at this size

## Next steps

- Experience term: rerun once the daily eval shows 300+ train and 100+ test games per
  variant. If "user only" beats the no-experience model beyond its interval, wire it into
  recommend() as the "your pool" reason (wasm `pool` field) with the measured per-bin pp
- Lane gold (lanegold.zig): reports from 500 train / 100 test games with timelines
  (865 timelines at last check); if it wins, store champion and pair gold in the model
  file (statsfile v2) and tell meiolol-b5 and meiolol-de
- Daily history chart: data/eval-history.tsv on the box; with a few days of lines, a
  "Model accuracy vs data" chart on the site's method page (meiolol-b5)
- Switch defaults to empiricalPriors once eval shows a gain at volume; retry pair
  evidence for role inference with shrinkage; comp features (damage mix, frontline)
  and rank brackets (participants.tier) when data allows

Why: a champion-role has ~60 games here, so its winrate is known to about ±6 pp, while
real differences between champions are 1-3 pp. Pair cells have a handful of games.
The data is the bottleneck, not the model form; the all-regions crawl (~135k games/day)
is what can move these numbers. Detectable now: the paired interval is ±0.0012 on 1334
test games, so a model at the published ~55% (log loss ~0.687) would show clearly.
